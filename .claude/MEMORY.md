# Project Memory

## Project Overview
- **Name**: VisionQuest
- **Description**: AI-coach portal for SPOKES workforce development; Sage (Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite) acts as a chat-first site manager
- **Tech stack**: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Prisma 6, Supabase Postgres (pgvector) + Storage, Tailwind 4, Playwright
- **Repo**: https://github.com/doclegg05/VisionQuest.git · Live: https://visionquest.onrender.com

## Current Status
`/ci-pipeline` autonomous engineering workflow command shipped to PR (branch `claude/engineering-workflow-lint-cicd-4eabbd`): spec (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-ci-pipeline-command-design.md) → conformance validator (`npm run ci-pipeline:validate`, 12 checks) → committed `.claude/commands/ci-pipeline.md`. Verified 12/12, grader untouched. Awaiting owner review/merge. Prior state unchanged and stable: eval-gate stabilization merged (PR #118) and maturity repair merged + deployed (PR #117); see docs/MATURITY_REVIEW.md.

## Last Session
- **Date**: 2026-07-22 (engineering-workflow session, worktree engineering-workflow-lint-cicd-4eabbd)
- **What we worked on**: Built the `/ci-pipeline` command — the autonomous sibling of `/feature`, modeled on Britt's agent-workflow diagram (ticket → Scout → Plan gate → Build → local test fail-loop → code-reviewer pass → push + draft PR → CI watch fail-loop → Engineer Review). Flow: brainstormed design → committed spec → goal-coach built `ci-pipeline:validate` conformance gate (12 content checks, red baseline 0/12) → a separate goal-runner agent authored `.claude/commands/ci-pipeline.md` to 12/12 → independently re-verified (validator output, grader diff empty, coherence read-through). Updated memory, pushed branch, opened PR.
- **What we decided**: `/ci-pipeline` is a committed team command (unlike personal /bug /chore /feature); exactly one human gate (plan approval); retry caps 3 local / 2 CI; draft PR opens BEFORE CI watch (CI only triggers on PRs to main); pipeline never merges. Prompt artifacts get validator-script conformance gates (falsifiable proof for goal runs).
- **Where we left off**: PR open from `claude/engineering-workflow-lint-cicd-4eabbd` awaiting owner review/merge (3 commits: spec, validator, command; plus memory update). Goal-runner's stray worktree `.claude/worktrees/pipeline-engineering-workflow-89c949` is clean at base and can be `git worktree remove`d. Optional follow-up: wire `ci-pipeline:validate` into the CI verify job.

## Open Items
- [x] Eval stabilization — DONE in PR #118 (2026-07-21): case restored to gating with 3-sample majority voting + search_forms attractor removed; canaries audited into `neverContain` with a freshness unit lock; soft warnings root-caused 9→0; tool_watch family runs informationally in CI
- [ ] **USER**: confirm retention durations in docs/DATA_RETENTION_POLICY.md (OWNER-CONFIRM markers)
- [ ] Product call: exempt or supply a PDF for `ai-data-consent` (release-of-information packet now ends pending-verification)
- [ ] Decide whether StudentSavedJob should carry verification fields (Application is covered)
- [ ] Add `/teacher/failed-extractions` to teacher nav (URL-only today)
- [ ] **USER**: trigger prod backfill once: `curl -X POST https://visionquest.onrender.com/api/internal/rag/backfill -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"` (idempotent; needs CRON_SECRET)
- [ ] Optional: COS_USER_ID/COS_API_TOKEN in Render for WV state jobs
- [ ] A11y for authenticated pages: seed a test user, add @axe-core/playwright to existing e2e specs (see docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-10-a11y-results.md)
- [ ] Dark-mode contrast sweep: hardcoded `bg-white` + ink tokens in StaffMfaPanel.tsx (same bug class fixed on /forgot-password)
- [ ] RAG corpus triage: 463 inactive ProgramDocuments need human review before embedding

## Key Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-06-09 | 6-phase chat-first rebuild plan locked | User-approved scope, models, UX direction |
| 2026-06-10 | Build inline, not background agents | Three background agents stalled with zero output |
| 2026-06-10 | `prisma migrate deploy` only on shared dev DB | `migrate dev` wants to reset it |
| 2026-06-10 | Semantic dedupe layers in memory extraction | Hash-only dedupe let rephrased facts through (17.4%→0.0%) |
| 2026-06-10 | Relative cosine-distance margin (0.04) for RAG | Weak shared-word FTS matches polluted top-3 under RRF |
| 2026-07-21 | Gemini safetySettings scoped to DANGEROUS_CONTENT only | Any explicit safety entry measurably shifts generation (flipped a gating tool-selection case; isolated via request-payload diff + same-hour control run on main) |
| 2026-07-21 | Eval-case demotion over gate-weakening | tool-teacher-lookup-student → non-gating tool_watch with documented restoration path, instead of widening acceptableTools |
| 2026-07-21 | PR #117 merged with a merge commit, not squash | 33 curated conventional commits worth preserving for bisection on a 6k-line change |
| 2026-07-21 | Gating tool cases vote 2-of-3 (`--samples=3`); flaky cases demote to visible `tool_watch`, never delete | Gemini tool selection non-deterministic at temp 0; invisible demotion is how canaries die (PR #118) |
| 2026-07-21 | search_forms query example de-certified ('the paper about missing class') | The example was the routing attractor three rounds of steering worked around; on the merged tree the case failed even majority voting until the attractor itself was removed |
| 2026-07-21 | Personal workflow commands (/bug, /chore, /feature) kept machine-local via .git/info/exclude | Owner call: personal ceremony definitions, not team artifacts — even the ignore rule stays out of the repo |
| 2026-07-21 | /project:fix-issue removed (PR #119) | Superseded by stricter /bug (reproducing failing test, review gate); two lanes for the same job means the looser one wins by default |
| 2026-07-22 | /ci-pipeline committed as a team command | Autonomous sibling of /feature: one plan-approval gate, then unattended build/test/CI fail-loops ending in a draft PR; never merges — matches the overnight-session working pattern |
| 2026-07-22 | Prompt artifacts gated by conformance validators (ci-pipeline:validate) | "Command matches spec" is unverifiable for a goal evaluator; a 12-check content gate makes it falsifiable, with the grader frozen during the goal run |
| 2026-07-22 | Workflow family naming: `<gate>-pipeline` (renamed /pipeline → /ci-pipeline pre-merge) | Owner plans more workflows testing other gates/lints; naming each by the gate it runs (a11y-pipeline, security-pipeline, …) keeps them differentiable |
| 2026-07-22 | Workflow roles extracted as named project agents: scout, builder, gate-runner (.claude/agents/) | Owner call: agents must be identifiable and reusable across the `<gate>-pipeline` family rather than rebuilt per workflow; gate-runner is parameterized by gate list; Plan stays with the orchestrator (owns the human gate) |

## Architecture Notes
- Sage agent: `src/lib/sage/agent/` — registry, executor (role-gated), HMAC confirm cards (`confirmation.ts`), write tools, career tools; every write ledgered in SageOperation + AuditLog
- Memory: `src/lib/sage/memory/` — RLS student-scoped, fire-and-forget extraction, weekly pg_cron consolidation
- Retrieval: hybrid pgvector+FTS RRF (`sage_hybrid_search` SQL fn); eval harnesses: `sage:rag:harness`, `sage:memory:eval`, `sage:agent:eval`
- Evals are hard gates — run all three before merging Sage-affecting changes

## Known Issues
- block-no-verify commit hook false-positives when a `git commit` command shares a Bash line with any `-n` flag (grep -n, sed -n) — split commands
- Port 3000 often occupied by an unrelated local app — e2e: use BASE_URL/PORT overrides
